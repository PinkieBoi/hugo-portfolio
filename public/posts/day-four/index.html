After only waking 3 times last night I am, for the first time in a long time, actually feeling somewhat rested!  I had to listen to my stories to first drift off to sleep because I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself daydreaming about &lsquo;The Detective&rsquo; but once I actually got myself down I didn&rsquo;t need to use them again.  Other than that I think I&rsquo;m actually starting to feel my medication start to take effect. I&rsquo;m much less focused on my own demise and have even had a few thoughts of the future - something I didn&rsquo;t expect quite so soon.
Maybe this will actually work for me&hellip;">

Maybe this will actually work for me&hellip;</p>
<p>As for my learning python, I&rsquo;m almost finished the typing tutor project.  I&rsquo;m not totally happy with version 1 but it will do until I can be bothered to animate the keyboard image and the text. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how I&rsquo;m going to implement the backspace key yet so I&rsquo;ll have to work that out first before I can make it function the way I think it should.</p>
