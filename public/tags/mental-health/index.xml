      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mood: Optimistic&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After only waking 3 times last night I am, for the first time in a long time, actually feeling somewhat rested!  I had to listen to my stories to first drift off to sleep because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop myself daydreaming about &amp;lsquo;The Detective&amp;rsquo; but once I actually got myself down I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to use them again.  Other than that I think I&amp;rsquo;m actually starting to feel my medication start to take effect. I&amp;rsquo;m much less focused on my own demise and have even had a few thoughts of the future - something I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect quite so soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mood: meh / slightly positive&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another night of broken sleep.  I was up every hour or so again with nightmares and cold sweats.   I usually listen to horror narrations to fall asleep although when I tried silence the nightmares lessened to the point that I&amp;rsquo;d call them dreams.  Perhaps tonight I&amp;rsquo;ll try to get to sleep in silence again and see how that works for an entire night - hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll actually get a full night&amp;rsquo;s sleep for once!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mood: Tired&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was up and down all last night (and part of this morning) with dreams that focus on my biggest fears and worries, each time waking up covered in sweat with a pounding headache.  It&amp;rsquo;s only day 2 and already I want to give up and quit.  I had hoped that on mirtazapine I would at least get a good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep but it seems that I won&amp;rsquo;t be so lucky this time around - maybe these side effects will diminish with time but I&amp;rsquo;m not hopeful for that either, I remember that last time I was on this medication once the dreams started they were here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mood:  Meh / Average&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I contacted my GP and restarted antidepressants.  To be clear I&amp;rsquo;m doing this solely to fulfil a promise - not because I expect any improvement. I promised that I&amp;rsquo;d make a real effort to recover so I&amp;rsquo;m on the drug that several US studies show is best for my particular circumstances.  This blog will serve as a record for me to look back on so that I can, at the very least, look back and accurately evaluate any progress I might make towartds stable mental health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
